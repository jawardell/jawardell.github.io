			<h5>Resource-Efficient Algorithms for Big Data</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Project completed under Dr. Funda and Dr. Zhang at Indiana University OurCS conference</li>
				implementing an optimized version of Misra-Gries streaming algorithm in C++
				<li>Abstract: How to efficiently process large datasets has become a central topic in a number of areas in computer science, including databases, machine learning and data mining. In this project participants are expected to design, implement, and evaluate algorithms for popular queries on large scale datasets using limited computational resources (space and time).</li>

			<h5>Robots and Cameras for Automated Plant Phenotyping</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Project completed at Carnegie Mellon University OurCS conference which implements an algorithm for detecting grapes in a photo using MATLAB CV Toolbox</li>
				<li>Abstract: This project investigates the problem of using robotics, cameras, and 3D modeling technology to better understand plant growth. This is part of an emerging research area called high throughput phenotyping, where automated technologies are used to gather plant information that can be used both for high efficiency plant production and for breeding plants
					with desirable characteristics. After reviewing the state of the art in this area, we brainstormed methods for the automated collection and processing of visual data. The goal is to build a prototype robotic system that can collect plant images, process the images into high-resolution 3D models, and automatically extract useful phenotype (e.g., stem width or leaf shape) information from the models.</li>

			<h5>Toward and Understanding of Skewed Top Corridors</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Lattice path counting, enumeration, and analysis using Java and Python</li>
				<li>Abstract: A lattice consists of points Z 2 with certain restrictions. We will study paths in the lattice with two allowable moves, up-right and down-right. The lattice path enumeration model that we propose consists of a starting point, an upper and lower bound, and all possible paths from said starting point to some end point. The area in which the paths are propagated is referred to as a corridor. The number of paths within the corridor depends on the initial values of the starting point, the nature of the upper and lower bounds, and the value placed at the starting point. In our model, the lower bound is a line with zero slope and the upper bound is a line with a variable slope. We call this model a skewed top corridor. Although the data changes because of the upper bounds slope, intriguing patterns and characteristics have been observed in the configurations of this environment.</li>

			<h5>Visualizing Patterns in Cayley Tables</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Wrote programs in Java to render Cayley tables for various operators</li>
				<li>Abstract: A group is a set of elements that are closed under an associative operation that includes both an identity and an inverse for each element. A Cayley Table is used to describe an operation on a finite group. Using colors to represent individual elements in the set enables one to recognize properties of the group. Using Java programming, color images were created to represent some groups. We will explore these images and discuss how some of the properties of each group are shown in the images.</li>
